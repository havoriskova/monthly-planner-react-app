              The most usefull thing for planning is definitely a monthly
              planner. I used to have very pretty large diaries, but soon during the
              year I´ve noticed that I hardly open them. I was also lazy to turn the
              pages to see if I haven´t forget something to do in the previous
              weeks. Monthly planner helped me a lot with organizing stuff, because
              it is simply just one page. It feels lighter and more fresh then just
              enormous amount of pages.
